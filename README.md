<h1>S4A Recruitment Assignment</h1>

Welcome to my repository. This repository contains all the codes for my recruitment assignment. There are 2 requests in my assignment:  
1. For requested Flight Number and date will respond with following :  
a. Cargo Weight for requested Flight  
b. Baggage Weight for requested Flight  
c. Total Weight for requested Flight  
2. For requested IATA Airport Code and date will respond with following :  
a. Number of flights departing from this airport,  
b. Number of flights arriving to this airport,  
c. Total number (pieces) of baggage arriving to this airport,  
d. Total number (pieces) of baggage departing from this airport.  

The results will be in JSON format. The data was generated from https://www.json-generator.com/ into 2 files, which are flight.json and cargo.json. I also used GSON to parse the json strings to java objects. Refer to and run the file Application.java for more information.
